Try setting anotherGrade to a number. What happens?

//Using what you’ve learned about making decisions, write an if statement that will only access the array if the value of index is less than the array's count. Uncomment and update the code below, then update the index constant to different numbers and see the results.

//Create two variables, one to count yes votes and one to count no votes. Each should start off with a value of zero.
callout(Exercise): Create a for…in loop that iterates over one of the vote arrays and checks the value of each vote. If the vote is true, the loop should add one vote to the yes variable. If it's false, it should add one vote to the no variable.

//After the loop has finished, write an if statement that compares the two values and prints a different message based on whether the vote passed or failed.

//Write a function that takes two arguments: a string describing the issue being voted on and an array with the issue's Bool votes. Move the for…in loop and the if statement inside the function, so it prints the results when you call the function with a particular issue's arguments. You should be able to call the function like this:
