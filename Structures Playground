//Using the struct syntax from this lesson, create a type for your real-world object with the properties and methods you thought of. Remembering to mark each property with let or var depending on whether or not it will be allowed to change. If you're not sure how to implement the body of one of the methods, describe what the method should do in a comment.
// Add your own struct here:
struct SmartLight {
    let brand: String
    var brightness: Int
    var isOn: Bool
    //toggle power
    mutating func togglePower () {
        isOn.toggle()
        print("The light is now \(isOn ? "on" : "off:")")
    }
    //change brightness
    mutating func dim(to level: Int) {
        brightness = level
        print ("Brightness set to \(brightness)%")

    }
}
//Use the struct you created to make a new instance of your type.
var livingRoomLight = SmartLight (brand: "Lumina", brightness: 80, isOn: true)
livingRoomLight.dim (to: 40)
livingRoomLight.togglePower()
